| Question   | File                                       | TL;DR                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Question 3 | [assignment_1_q3.py](./assignment_1_q3.py) | Function ```get_table```create distribution tables; ```generate_sample``` is to generate one likelihood-weighted sample, ```MPE``` is to estimate the probability of all variable value combinations. |
| Question 4 | [assignment_1_q4.py](./assignment_1_q4.py) | Function ```heuristic_estimation``` implements the proposed heuristic estimation.                                                                                                                     |
| Question 5 | [assignment_1_q5.py](./assignment_1_q5.py) | The code is to calculate the Equation (5), whose factorization is represented in Equation (6).                                                                                                        |
| Question 6 | [assignment_1_q6.py](./assignment_1_q6.py) | The code is to simulate policy iteration with initial ```V=0``` and solve the LP form of the MDP. In both cases, they output (nearly) the same.                                                       |
